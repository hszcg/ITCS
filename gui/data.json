I will\nnot always follow the historical order of events\nand the style will be rather informal, like telling a story and\nfocussing on the bits I personally find interesting and know\nmore about. I will not talk about pseudo-randomness, but rather about\nstronger forms of randomness (quite a few of them). I will talk about\nrandomness of binary strings and infinite binary sequences, and focus\non the latter. Randomness of other mathematical objects can be defined\naccordingly through standard coding.<br>\n<br>\nIn the first lecture I will focus on motivating and presenting the\nmathematical foundations of the theory, along with occasional key\nresults. The theme of the second lecture will be computational lowness\n(or anti-randomness) which\nis a rather popular theme in this area nowadays. In the final lecture\nI will talk about measures of complexity that compare infinite\nsequences according to how random they are.<br>\n<br>\nI will try to keep the lectures reasonably self-contained so that\npeople can drop in after having missed a lecture.<br>\n<br>\nSome encyclopaedic texts on the subject are:<br>\n<p class='link'><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Computability-Randomness-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199652600' target=\"_blank\">http://www.amazon.com/Computability-Randomness-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199652600</a></p>\n\n<p class='link'><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Randomness-Complexity-Applications-Computability/dp/0387955674' target=\"_blank\">http://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Randomness-Complexity-Applications-Computability/dp/0387955674</a></p>\n\n<p class='link'><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Kolmogorov-Complexity-Applications-Computer/dp/0387339981' target=\"_blank\">http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Kolmogorov-Complexity-Applications-Computer/dp/0387339981</a></p>\nA few of the results I will present are too recent to be found in\nthese books, but references to papers\nwill be given upon request.", "extra": "", "venue": "1-222 FIT Building", "speaker_bio": "I got my PhD from the University of Leeds in 2004.
