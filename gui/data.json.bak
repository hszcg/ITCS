{"seminars": {"counter": [], "seminar": [{"extra": "", "abstract": "In this short 3-lecture course I will discuss the subject of\nAlgorithmic randomness\nand in particular the mathematical theory that stems from the\nfollowing questions and notions:\n\n\n- What do we mean by randomness?\n- how can we define randomness?\n- Focus on binary sequences: finite/infinite\n- Randomness/coding information relationships\n- The other end: anti-randomness\n- Which sequence is more random?\n\n\nI will start with the foundations of algorithmic randomness\n(Kolmogorov, Solomonoff, Levin, Chaitin) and proceed\nto a number of interesting results, most of them quite recent. I will\nnot always follow the historical order of events\nand the style will be rather informal, like telling a story and\nfocussing on the bits I personally find interesting and know\nmore about. I will not talk about pseudo-randomness, but rather about\nstronger forms of randomness (quite a few of them). I will talk about\nrandomness of binary strings and infinite binary sequences, and focus\non the latter. Randomness of other mathematical objects can be defined\naccordingly through standard coding.\n\n\nIn the first lecture I will focus on motivating and presenting the\nmathematical foundations of the theory, along with occasional key\nresults. The theme of the second lecture will be computational lowness\n(or anti-randomness) which\nis a rather popular theme in this area nowadays. In the final lecture\nI will talk about measures of complexity that compare infinite\nsequences according to how random they are.\n\n\nI will try to keep the lectures reasonably self-contained so that\npeople can drop in after having missed a lecture.\n\n\nSome encyclopaedic texts on the subject are:\n\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Computability-Randomness-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199652600\n\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Randomness-Complexity-Applications-Computability/dp/0387955674\n\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Kolmogorov-Complexity-Applications-Computer/dp/0387339981\n\n\nA few of the results I will present are too recent to be found in\nthese books, but references to papers\nwill be given upon request.", "title": "Introduction to Algorithmic Randomness", "venue": "1-222 FIT Building", "speaker_bio": "I got my PhD from the University of Leeds in 2004.
